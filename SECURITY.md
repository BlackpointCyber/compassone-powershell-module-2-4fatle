## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Submit vulnerability details to our security team via encrypted email
3. Expect initial response within 48 hours
4. Cooperate with security team for validation and resolution

### Required Information

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Module version affected
- PowerShell version tested
- Platform/OS details
- Any proposed mitigation

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Initial Response | 48 hours |
| Vulnerability Validation | 5 business days |
| Fix Development | Based on severity |
| Security Patch Release | Based on severity |

### Disclosure Policy

- Coordinated disclosure after patch availability
- Credit given to security researchers
- Public acknowledgment in release notes
- CVE assignment when applicable

### Security Contact Information

- Email: security@blackpoint.io
- PGP Key: [Security Team PGP Key]
- Response Hours: 24/7 for critical vulnerabilities

## Security Requirements

### Transport Security

- TLS 1.2+ required for all API communications
- Supported cipher suites:
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- Valid SSL/TLS certificate from trusted CA required

### Credential Storage

- SecretStore integration required
- AES-256 encryption for stored credentials
- 90-day key rotation policy
- Secure memory handling for runtime credentials

### PowerShell Execution Policy

- Windows: RemoteSigned or AllSigned required
- Non-Windows: RemoteSigned equivalent required
- Code signing verification enforced

### Rate Limiting

- Initial wait: 2 seconds
- Maximum wait: 30 seconds
- Maximum retries: 5
- Exponential backoff multiplier: 2

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

1. API Key Storage
   - Must use SecretStore for persistent storage
   - No plaintext storage allowed
   - Regular rotation required

2. Token Handling
   - Secure memory handling required
   - Token expiration enforcement
   - Automatic token refresh implementation

3. Secret Rotation
   - 90-day maximum lifetime
   - Automated rotation support
   - Immediate rotation on compromise

### Error Handling

1. Sensitive Data Protection
   - Remove credentials from error messages
   - Sanitize stack traces
   - Secure error logging implementation

2. Logging Requirements
   - Secure logging practices
   - No sensitive data in logs
   - Log integrity protection

### Audit Logging

Required Event Logging:
- Authentication attempts
- Authorization decisions
- Configuration changes
- Security events

Log Requirements:
- 90-day minimum retention
- Integrity monitoring
- Tamper detection

## Security Response

### Severity Levels and Response Times

| Severity | Response Time | Update Frequency |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Critical | 2 hours | Every 4 hours |
| High | 4 hours | Every 8 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours | Daily |
| Low | 72 hours | Weekly |

### Incident Response Procedures

1. Initial Assessment
   - Severity determination
   - Impact analysis
   - Containment strategy

2. Containment
   - Threat isolation
   - Affected system identification
   - Emergency mitigation

3. Eradication
   - Root cause analysis
   - Vulnerability patching
   - Security control updates

4. Recovery
   - System restoration
   - Security verification
   - Service resumption

5. Post-Incident Analysis
   - Incident documentation
   - Process improvement
   - Lessons learned
